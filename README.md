Project Title: Optimizing Vehicle Stoplight Trajectory
Project Goal: Creating a controller to optimize a vehicle's trajectory to a stoplight based on it's distance to the stoplight and when the stoplight will turn from red to green. Ideally, this will avoid the car having to come to a complete stop and create a smooth, optimized trajectory through the light.

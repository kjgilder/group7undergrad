Project Title: Optimizing Vehicle Stoplight Trajectory
Project Goal: Creating a controller to optimize a vehicle's trajectory to a stoplight based on it's distance to the stoplight and when the stoplight will turn from red to green. Ideally, this will avoid the car having to come to a complete stop and create a smooth, optimized trajectory through the light. 

ASSUMPTIONS: 
- IMPORTANT! We are assuming there is no LEAD vehicle in this simulation (and ignore any input from the lead vehicle in the .bag file AND ignore any output related to the lead vehicle)

-  We are assuming that the stoplight is at a set distance from the vehicle AND is changing from red to green at a set time.
